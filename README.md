# Project Name
**0x1D. C - Binary trees**

## Author's Details
Name: *Wendy Munyasi.*

Email: *wendymunyasi@gmail.com*

Tel: *+254707240068.*

##  Requirements
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   The `main.c` files are used to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `binary_trees.h`.
*   All your header files should be include guarded.

##  More Info
*   Please use this data structure for this project:
```
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;

```
**Binary Search Tree**
```
typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;
```
**AVL Tree**
